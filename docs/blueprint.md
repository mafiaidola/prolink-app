# **App Name**: ProLink

## Core Features:

- Profile Creation and Customization: Allow users to create and customize their digital profiles with various fields, including logo, name, job title, company info, and custom links, enabling full control over their professional representation. A tool to determine optimal field configuration may optionally be used to provide helpful advice to the user, when appropriate.
- Theming and Appearance: Enable users to select from at least 10 pre-designed themes and animated backgrounds to personalize the visual appearance of their profiles. Includes options for modern, classic, glass morphism, and neon styles.
- Custom URL Generation: Provide users with the ability to create custom slugs for their profile links (e.g., yoursite.com/profile-name), ensuring unique and brand-aligned URLs for easy sharing.
- Advanced QR Code Generator: Allow users to create customized QR codes for their profiles, including style options (dots, squares, circles), gradient colors, logo integration, and export formats (PNG, PDF).
- Bilingual Support: Offer full support for both Arabic (RTL) and English (LTR) languages, with an easy-to-access language switch for visitors.
- File Management: Implement a file upload system for logos and images, replacing reliance on external links, with automatic image compression for optimized performance. Only the logo needs to be customizable by file upload. The other 'animated backgrounds' can be handled through built-in, non-user-customizable generators.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant purple (#A020F0) to evoke creativity and sophistication, suitable for a modern digital presence.
- Background color: Light purple (#E6D6FC), a very light tint of the primary color. Provides a calm, professional feel without being distracting.
- Accent color: A warm pink (#F020A0), analogous to the primary color. To be used for interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines, 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use animated icons next to custom fields to visually enhance the user experience.
- Implement a responsive design that adapts seamlessly to all devices (desktop, tablet, smartphone) with a focus on modern visual effects like Glass Morphism.
- Employ CSS animations for smooth, subtle transitions and interactive feedback to enhance user engagement.
